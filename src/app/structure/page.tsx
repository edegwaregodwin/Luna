              We operate through two main segments: Educational workshops and
              dispenser donations to schools Dispenser and menstrual product
              subscriptions to organisations with the commitment to donate one
              product for every one we supply.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our primary segment is funded entirely by donations and to ensure
              transparency, we have separated the two segments into two separate
              entities. All of our fundraising goes to our charity and is only
              ever spent on educational materials for schools or menstrual
              product dispenser donations. Our subscriptions, menstrual product
              donations and the money we have raised from Schroders, Reckitt and
              Sodexo comes under our social enterprise. This structure ensures
              that the money we raise is only ever used for its intended
              purpose.
